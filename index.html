        <p>In common usage,<mark> Climate change</mark> describes global warming
        —the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and 
        its effects on Earth's climate system.<mark> Climate change</mark> in
        a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes
        to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average
        temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is 
        primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels. Fossil 
        fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and 
        industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably 
        carbon dioxide and methane.Greenhouse gases absorb 
        some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms 
        from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more 
        heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.
        Due to<mark> Climate change</mark>,<mark> deserts are expanding</mark>
        ,<mark> while heat 
        waves</mark> and <mark>are becoming more common</mark>. Increased 
        warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, 
        glacial retreat and sea ice loss. Higher temperatures are 
        also causing more intense <mark>storms,droughts, and other weather
        extremes.</mark> Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral
        reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate
        or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimise future
        warming are successful, some effects will continue 
        for centuries. These include ocean heating,ocean 
        acidification and sea level rise.</p>

            <font size="6">The Effects of <mark>Global Warming</mark> on <mark>Animals</mark></font>
        <p>
        <mark>Global warming</mark>, scientists say, is responsible not only for shrinking ice
        caps but also for a surge in extreme weather that is causing heat waves,
        forest fires, and droughts. The polar bear standing on a chunk of shrinking 
        ice, apparently stranded, has become a familiar image, a symbol of the
        devastating effects of <mark>Climate change.</mark>Affected wildlife populations can 
        sometimes move into new spaces and continue to thrive. But concurrent
        human population growth means that many land areas that might be suitable
        for such “refugee wildlife” are fragmented and already cluttered with
        residential and industrial development. Cities and roads can act as obstacles,
        preventing plants and animals from moving into alternative habitats.No matter 
        your position on the issue—whether <mark>Global warming </mark>is aggravated by 
        the burning of fossil fuels (the position of the vast majority of the world's scientists) 
        or an unavoidable environmental trend that's completely unaffected by human behavior—the 
        fact is that our world is gradually, and inexorably, heating up. We can't even begin to 
        imagine the effect rising global temperatures will have on human civilization, but we 
        can see for ourselves, right now, how it impacts some of our favorite <mark> animals</mark>.
        The <mark>Ringed seal</mark> is not currently endangered; while no accurate estimate exists, 
        there are believed to be about 300,000 individuals in Alaska alone and probably more than 2 million 
        <mark> indigenous</mark> to the world's Arctic regions. The problem is that these seals nest 
        and breed on pack ice and ice floes, precisely the habitats most at risk from <mark>global 
        warming</mark>, and they're one of the main sources of food both for already-endangered <mark>polar
        bears and indigenous humans.</mark> On the other end of the food chain, ringed seals subsist on 
        <mark>various Arctic fish and crustaceans;</mark> it's unknown what the knock-on effects might be 
        if the population of this mammal gradually (or suddenly) plummeted.Unlike the other animals on 
        this list, the beluga whale isn't all that negatively impacted by <mark>global warming</mark>
        (or at least, it isn't any more vulnerable to global warming than any other sea-dwelling mammal).
        Rather,<mark>Global warming</mark> global temperatures have made it easier for well-meaning
        tourists to flock to Arctic waters on whale-watching expeditions, and the ambient noise of 
        engines can jam their ability to communicate, navigate, and detect prey or approaching threats.
        Here's where <mark>Global warming </mark>gets real: can it really be that Nemo the clownfish 
        is on the verge of extinction? Well, the sad fact is that coral reefs are especially susceptible
        to rising ocean temperatures and acidification, and the sea anemones that sprout from these
        reefs make ideal homes for clownfish, shielding them from predators. As coral reefs bleach 
        and decay, anemones dwindle in number, and so do the populations of orange clownfish.
        (Adding insult to injury, the worldwide success of Finding Nemo and Finding Dory could have
        contributed to the amount of aquarium sales of orange clownfish, which further decreases
        its numbers.)The <mark>koala</mark> subsists almost exclusively on the leaves of the eucalyptus tree, 
        and this tree is extremely sensitive to temperature change.
